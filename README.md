# Difference between http and https
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a protocol thatâ€™s used by a client and server which allows you to communicate with other websites. It is not a secure means of communicating over the web.

HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (also referred to as HTTP over TLS or HTTP over SSL). It is a secure means of communication over the web so, credentials and other private information can be used on this protocol.

# Http methods
This is the way the client communicate to the server to get a resource. We have two most common ones, which are Get and Post methods.
GET is used to request data from a specified resource.
POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

# Api
It is application programming interface.  It is a set of tools, and protocols for building softwares.
It also specifies how software component should interact.

# Difference between soap and rest api
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)  and REST (Representational State Transfer).
Soap is Language, platform, and transport independent (REST requires use of HTTP) and Automation when used with certain language products.
Rest is Efficient (SOAP uses XML for all messages, REST can use smaller message formats) and Fast (no extensive processing required).

# Json
It is used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network connection. It is used to transmit data between a server and web application.
